# Customer Banking
Module 3 Challenge

## Function

This program is designed to calculate simple interest for a Savings and CD account based on each account's balance, interest, and term \(in months\).

## Files

The **Account** file contains the methods used by each account file \(Savings and CD\) to set the interest and the balance.  The Account class and its methods are called into these files for their calculations.

Both the **Savings** and **CD** files use the Account class and its methods to in an instance of the Account class to create a function that will determine the ending balance for each respective account.

Finally, the **Customer Banking** file puts all of these parts together by importing the functions created in the Savings and CD files.  The user is prompted for inputs to each of these functions so that the program can calculate their final balance for each account based on those inputs.

## Credit

I am thankful for great assistance from the wonderful tutor Lindelwe.  My code reflects her advice as well as portions provided by examples throughout our lessons for Module 3.
